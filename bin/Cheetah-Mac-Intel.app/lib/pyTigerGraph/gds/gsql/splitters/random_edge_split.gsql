    This query splits vertices into at most 3 parts randomly. It does so by using a boolean attribute to
    indicate which part a vertex belongs to.

    Only `attr1` and `ratio1` are required. `attr1`, `attr2`, `attr3` have to be attributes that already
    exist in the database. `ratio1`, `ratio2`, `ratio3` have to be numbers in [0, 1), and `ratio1+ratio2+ratio3<=1`.

    Usage:
      random_vertex_split(attr1="name", ratio1=0.6): 
        A random 60% of vertices will have their attribute "name" set to True, and others False.
      random_vertex_split(attr1="name", ratio1=0.6, attr2="name2", ratio2=0.2):
        A random 60% of vertices will have their attribute "name" set to True, and a random 20% of vertices will have
        their attribute "name2" set to True. The two parts are disjoint. 
      random_vertex_split(attr1="name", ratio1=0.6, attr2="name2", ratio2=0.2, attr3="name3", ratio3=0.2):
        A random 60% of vertices will have their attribute "name" set to True, a random 20% of vertices will have
        their attribute "name2" set to True, and another random 20% of vertices will have their attribute "name3" set to True. 
        The three parts are disjoint.

    Parameters:
      attr1  : Name of the vertex attribute for part 1. It will be set to True if the vertex is assigned to this part.
      ratio1 : Proportion of vertices in part 1.
      attr1  : Name of the vertex attribute for part 2. It will be set to True if the vertex is assigned to this part.
      ratio1 : Proportion of vertices in part 2.
      attr1  : Name of the vertex attribute for part 3. It will be set to True if the vertex is assigned to this part.
      ratio1 : Proportion of vertices in part 3.
      stypes : Edge types to be included.
