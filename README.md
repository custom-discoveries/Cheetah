<h3>
- Cheetah is a Rapid Application Deployment (RAD) Tool for performing TigerGraph Database Administrative functions.

- Cheetah is a Linux / MacOS based command line tool that assist in deploying TigerGraph Database DDL scripts on a local instance and deploy in the cloud with a minimal effort.

- One of Cheetah’s super powers is the ability to “Flip” between Local and Remote Servers. Allowing a developer to develop loacally and deploy in their TigerGraph database schema in the cloud.

- Cheetah is designed around the concept of “Separation of Concerns,” meaning that each “Graph” is loaded into the database as a “local” instance and is maintained in a separate folder structure – known as a project directory.

- Cheetah has an option to allow you to create you this project directory and populate it with template TigerGraph DDL scripts, to get you up and running in no time.
