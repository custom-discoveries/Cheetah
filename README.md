</h2>
<h3>
- Cheetah is a command line Rapid Application Deployment (RAD) Tool for performing TigerGraph Database Administrative functions.

- Cheetah is a Linux (Ubuntu) / MacOS based command line tool that assist in deploying TigerGraph Database DDL scripts on a local instance and deploy in the cloud with a minimal effort.

- One of Cheetah’s super powers is the ability to “Flip” between Local and Remote Servers, allowing a developer to develop loacally and deploy in their TigerGraph database schema in the cloud.

- Cheetah is designed around the concept of “Separation of Concerns,” meaning that each “Graph” is loaded into the database as a “local” instance and is maintained in a separate folder structure – known as a project directory.

- Cheetah has an option to allow you to create you this project directory and populate it with template TigerGraph DDL scripts, to get you up and running in no time.

- To get started: Simply clone this repository and run the initCheetah.sh from the bin directory to set up your environment path.
  - Once your environment path is setup, quit out of the tool, then clone one of the other Tigergraph examples in cusotm-discoveries repository.
      - With the exception of Ethereum, which is a pure python programmatically application that will create a simple schema with Vertex and Edges
  - Enter the project dirctory that you cloned and run the command Cheetah, you should be prompted for environment variables.
