## <p align="center">Cheetah</p>
- Cheetah is a Rapid Application Deployment (RAD) Tool for TigerGraph graph database, for either Local or Cloud base implementation.

- Cheetah is a Linux / MacOS based tool to assist in TigerGraph Database Administrative functions.

- One of Cheetah’s super powers is the ability to “Flip” between local and Remote Servers. Allowing a developer to develop DDL scripts on a local instance and deploy in the cloud with a minimal effort.

- Cheetah is designed around the concept of “Separation of Concerns,” meaning that each “Graph” is loaded into the database as a “local” instance and is maintained in a separate folder structure – known as a project directory.
